I came up with the solution based on the mathematical concept of finding prime factors and summing them. Here's how I approached it:

1. I recognized that the problem involves finding the minimum number of operations to achieve 'n' H characters in a file.

2. I thought about how to break down 'n' into its prime factors because prime factors are the fundamental building blocks of any number.

3. I realized that by finding the prime factors of 'n' and summing them, I could determine the minimum number of operations required to reach 'n'.

4. To find the prime factors, I used a while loop to repeatedly divide 'n' by the smallest possible divisor, incrementing the divisor until 'n' became 1.

5. During each iteration of the while loop, if 'n' was divisible by the current divisor, I added that divisor to the 'operations' variable and updated 'n' by dividing it by the divisor.

6. I continued this process until 'n' became 1, and the sum of divisors in the 'operations' variable gave me the minimum number of operations required.
